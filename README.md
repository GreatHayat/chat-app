# chat-app
this is a very basic chat app code using socket.io in nodejs to understand the working of web sockets

# Installation 
there is no rocket science to install and setup this app on your local machine, you just need to clone the repository and run the following command
- npm install

# open in browser
after completing the installation process run the app using following command
- npm start
- open the browser and type the url http://localhost:5000/?username=john
- paste the above mentioned URL in multiple tabs with the different value of username


# Note
I have plan to improve the app functionality and UI when I have time.

## Happy Coding!
